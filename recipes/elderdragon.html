    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Elder Dragon belly or shoulder steak</li>
        <li>2Tbsp Sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Demon sprout black pepper</li>
        <li>1Tbsp Red slime oil</li>
        <li>3 Mandrake roots</li>
        <li>5cloves of hopping garlic</li>
        <li>1 Feather of cockatrice</li>
        <li>20ml harpy tears</li>
        <li>20ml Electric sheep milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Naturally Thaw Elder dragon meat 1hr before cooking. Pat dry the meat with papyrus to ensure they are properly dry. To ensure that there are no scales that were
            missed during processing, comb with an adamantite or higher grade knife.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Rub the steak with 1 Tbsp of Sea salt and a pinch of Demon sprout black pepper prior to frying. This will remove the any remaining moisture and season the meat.
        For enhanced flavor, season the meat 1 day prior and leave in cooler-box for 24hrs before cooking.    
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a heavy bottomed pan for 5-10 mins (On High) until hot steam is visible from the pan. Add 1 Tbsp of Red slime oil to the pan to further increase
            the heat of the pan. (Optional) Added fragranced butter to improve the scent.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Use tongs to carefully place the dragon meat on the hot pan. Angle the meat to sear the edges if needed. Cook for 3-4 minutes to ensure both sides are
            evenly browned. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce to low heat and add chopped Mandrake roots, chopped cloves of Hopping garlic to the browned meat. Garlic may still hop around while in the pan, 
            keep watch and use a lid to prevent any chopped garlic from hopping away!
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>As the roots and garlic continue to sizzle, add 20ml of Eletric sheep milk to the pan. Constantly use a spoon and baste the creamy sauce over the browned steak. 
            Do this for both sides each for 1min. Then add 20ml of harpy tears. This will sweeten the dragon meat and help soften the texture. If Electric sparks from adding
            the milk are too bright, consider wearing sunglasses to prevent damage to the eyes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook for a further 2mins and then check temperate of the steak with a flame orb. You can also ask your party's magic user to cast 'status' to check that the steak is
            well cooked. Aim for 52 degrees celcius.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer to a warm plate and let it rest for 5mins. Add 1 Feather of cockatrice to the steak for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
